# A lightweight library for JSON Siren

```siren``` is a lightweight JS library for manipulating JSON Siren object.

## JSON Siren and hypermedia

[JSON Siren](https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren) is a JSON Hypermedia
format.

## siren library principles

Siren format can be viewed as an envelop around the payload of your object
defined by the properties attribute. This way a Siren document makes a clear
distinction between the data of the object and the meta-information related
to hypermedia.
